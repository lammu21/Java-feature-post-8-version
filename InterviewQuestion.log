---------------------------Optional Important interveiw Question ---------------------------

What is the Optional class in Java 8?
Answer: Optional is a container object which may or may not contain a value. It helps to avoid NullPointerExceptions by providing a way to check presence or absence of a value before accessing it.	TCS, Infosys	2024, 2025

Why was Optional introduced in Java 8?
Answer: Optional was introduced to reduce null pointer exceptions and provide better APIs for handling missing (null) values in a more functional style.	Cognizant, Capgemini	2024, 2025

How do you create an Optional instance?
Answer: Use Optional.of(value) for non-null, Optional.ofNullable(value) for nullable values, and Optional.empty() for no value.	Infosys, HCL	2024, 2025

Difference between Optional.of() and Optional.ofNullable()?
Answer: Optional.of() throws NullPointerException if value is null; Optional.ofNullable() can handle null and returns an Optional.empty() if value is null.	Accenture	2025

How does Optional help avoid NullPointerException?
Answer: Optional forces the developer to explicitly check for value presence before accessing it, thus reducing the chance of null pointer exceptions.	TCS	2024

Explain key methods of Optional.
Answer: Some methods are isPresent(), get(), orElse(), orElseGet(), orElseThrow(), filter(), map(), flatMap().	Cognizant, Persistent	2025

Show a use-case for Optional in real-world code.
Answer: <code>Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getName()); if (name.isPresent()) { ... }</code> This pattern avoids null checks and NullPointerExceptions.	Capgemini, Infosys	2025

What is the use of 'orElse', 'orElseGet', and 'orElseThrow' in Optional?
Answer: 'orElse' returns the value or a default, 'orElseGet' gets value or supplies one, 'orElseThrow' throws exception if value is absent.	Cognizant	2025

Pitfalls/Disadvantages of Optional usage?
Answer: Overuse makes code complex; calling get() without isPresent() can still cause exceptions.	Infosys	2024

How is Optional used with Stream API?

Answer: Methods like findFirst(), findAny(), min(), max() return Optional, and can be chained with map, filter, flatMap functions.	HCL, TCS	2024, 2025


---------------------------DateTime Important interveiw Question ---------------------------

1. Why java.time introduced in Java 8 ?

    Answer : to Standardize the date and time API and to OverCome the flaws of previous date and time classes
    (java.util.Date,java.util.Calendar,java.text.SimpleDateFormat) like like mutability,thread safety,poor API design etc.

2. Difference between LocalDate, LocalTime, and LocalDateTime?
   Answer : LocalDate represents a date without time, (Year Month Date) example : 2023-10-05
            LocalTime represents a time without date,(Hour,Minute,Second,Nanosecond) example : 14:30:00
            LocalDateTime represents both date and time (Year, Month , date,hours,minutes,seconds,nanoseconds)
            example : 2023-10-05T14:30:00

3.	What is Instant used for?
    Answer : Instant respresents a specific moment on the timeline in UTC (Coordinated unviersal time )
             It is used for timestamps and is suitable for storing in databases.
             example : 2023-10-05T14:30:00Z (Z indicates UTC time zone).

4.	Difference between Period and Duration?
    Answer : Periods respresents a date based amount of time in terms of years, months,days
                example : Period.ofDays(10),Period.ofMonths(2)
             Durations represents a time based amount of time in terms of hours,minutes,seconds,nanoseconds
                example : Duration.ofHours(5),Duration.ofMinutes(30)

5.	How do you convert Instant to LocalDateTime in a specific timezone?
    Answer : Use LocalDatTime ofInstant() method along with ZoneId
             example : LocalDateTime idt =LocalDateTime.ofInstant(instant,ZoneId.systemDefault());

6.	How do you format and parse dates using DateTimeFormatter?
    Answer : Use DateTimeFormatter class to define a pattern and
              example : DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy");
              then use format() method to format and parse() to parse strings to date objects.
              example : String formattedDate = LocalDate.now().format(formatter);
                        LocalDate parsedDate = LocalDate.parse("05-10-2023",formatter);

7.	Why is the new Date-Time API immutable and thread-safe?
     Answer : immutabllity of date-time objects ensures once created they cannot be modified,
              this prevents accidental changes and makes them inherently thread-safe.

8.	How would you calculate age from a given birthdate? 
    Answer : User Period.between() method to calculate the Difference between two Localdate instances 
             example : LocalDate birthdate = LocalDate.of(1990, Month.JANUARY,1);
                       LocalDate currentDate = LocalDate.now();
                       Period age = Period.between(birthdate,currentDate);          

9.	What is the difference between ZoneId and ZoneOffset?
    Answer : ZoneId represents a time zone region like "America/Newyork" which include daysaving rules 
             ZoneOffset represents a fixed offset from UTC like +2:00 or -5:00


10.	Can LocalDateTime store timezone information? Why or why not?
    Answer : No,it only stores date and time without timezone information 
             DateTimeZoned class is used to store date, time along with timezone information.
