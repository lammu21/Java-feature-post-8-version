ARUN INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

1.Question : what is Spring constant pool?
Answer : String Constant pool is special dedicated memory space inside java heap,where string literals get stored

2 .Method overloading and overriding practical scenerios. 
Answer : overloading compile-time, same method name with different number of parameters
         overriding
3.Exception handling in method overriding case(parent and child exceptions). 
Answer : if a checked exception declared in parent class,
          Child class can declare same exception or 
          exception which should be of subclass 
          Declare no exception
4.@Qualifier and @autowired annotations
   @Qualifier will help in determining which class object needs to be Created 
   when there multiple beans of same type exist.
   @Autowired will inject bean/object automatically..
 
5.Dependency Injection and ioc.
  Dependency Injection : instead of class creating its Dependencies,
                         they are injected externally via Construct,Field,Setter..
  Inversion of Control : Creating & managing objects taken care by spring instead of Developer,
                         known as IOC


6 Java 8 streams coding question using filter, map and flat map concept. 
   stream.filter : it gives elements , only if the condition on filter is true  
   stream.map : Transform each element to another form 
   stream.flatMap : Transform elements and gives flatten nested structure singe stream
   Example : 
        List <String> name = Arrays.asList("java","Springboot","SpringFram","SpringSecurity").
        name.stream()
            .filter(n -> n.startwith("s")
            .map(String : : toUpperCase())
            .forEach(System.out::println);

        name.stream()
            .filter(n->n.startWith("S")
            .flatMap(String :: toLowerCase())
            .forEach(System.out.println);


7. Coding question to print the frequency of characters in a string. 
    Map <Character,Integer> ans = new Map<>();

    for(Char x : input.toCharArray())
    {
      if(x !=" "){
      res.put(x,ans.getOrDefault(x,0)+1)
      }

    }

    for(Map.Entry(characters,Integer) : ans.entrySet())
    {
     sysout(entrySet.getKey() + "->" entrySet.getValue());
    }

8. Spring Security implementation. 
   Spring Security provides 
   authentication : who are you ?
   authorization : what you can do ?

   Commonly used Securing REST API are 
     1.UserDetailsService 
     2.JWT tokens
     3.OAuth. 


9 .Advantages of microservices over Monolithic. 
   1. flexibility to have it's own techstack for a service.
   2. Independent deployment and scaling
   3.fault isolation 
   4.faster development with paralle teams

10. API Gateway concept. 
    API gateway acts as single entry point for a client request.
    it will route requests to respective microservice based on loadbalancing,
    it will take care authentication and logging between microservices

  
11. How do you handle if one microservice goes down.
    Fallback Method : will return cacched or Default data, when a service is down.
    Load balancer & Service Discovery : will route request to another instance of that service if exist.
    retries with backoff : will configure on retries with limited number with delay.
    Circuit breaker : prevent repeated calls for failed service gives back fallback response

 
12. Sql query to print employee with second highest salary . 
    SELECT * FROM employee where salary = 
      (Select Max(Salary) from employee 
      where salary < (Select Max (salary) from employee ))
 
SQL query to print highest salary of employee from each dept.
   SELECT max(salary) from employee groupby dept_id;
